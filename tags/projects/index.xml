      <title>A Golang implementation of PasswordSafe V3, ready for Beta</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The password database I have been implementing in go is ready for Beta! The DB is implemented using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pwsafe.org/&#34;&gt;password safe&lt;/a&gt; version 3
database spec. Enough of the features for this are now working that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tkuhlman/gopwsafe/releases/tag/0.3.0&#34;&gt;0.3.0 release&lt;/a&gt; is ready for others to test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using this code for months and would encourage anyone else needing a password DB to check it out now. I have particularly enjoyed the ability
to search across multiple open password dbs at one time. This was the primary itch I was scratching in taking up this project. Though that feature has been
implemented for months the gui it has been missing some basics such as a reminder to save after changes, the ability to change a DB password and to make a
new DB. These features are now all working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still a beta release because there are many missing features and some known bugs. The primary bug right now is that closing an open DB doesn&amp;rsquo;t work
without closing the entire program. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tkuhlman/gopwsafe&#34;&gt;project readme&lt;/a&gt; has a good running list of missing features in the Roadmap
section. Primarily these are features that take advantage of have multiple DBs open at once, such as the ability to move records from one DB to another.
Lastly the gtk gui could use countless tweaks to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you test it out have any feedback or find any bugs use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tkuhlman/gopwsafe/issues&#34;&gt;project issues&lt;/a&gt; section to notify me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Weechat Command Queues</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://weechat.org&#34;&gt;weechat&lt;/a&gt; for much of the day and have issue regular repetitive commands periodically.
If you are in the same situation you may find the &lt;a href=&#34;https://weechat.org/scripts/source/queue.py.html/&#34;&gt;queue plugin&lt;/a&gt; I recently modified to be useful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The queue plugin simply allows you to build up a list of commands then run them all at once. My
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/weechat/scripts/pull/137/files&#34;&gt;modification&lt;/a&gt; was to allow saving these across restarts of weechat.
That way I can build up a few queues I use regularily and just call them whenever needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example when I start my day I just execute &lt;code&gt;/qu exec morning&lt;/code&gt; to switch my away status, announce my availability in a couple of rooms, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Launchpad Merge Proposal Helper Script</title>
      <link>http://backgroundprocess.com/code/mp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written a script to aid in merge proposals done with &lt;a href=&#34;https://launchpad.net/&#34;&gt;Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;.
Simply run the command with the url of the merge proposal as the argument and the script will
 spawn a shell with the working directory being the code with the uncommitted
merge. You can then diff the code, run tests or whatever else as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you exit the shell you will be prompted to merge, if you choose to do so a commit message will be
populated for you and opened in an editor so you can edit as you choose. This is also your 2nd
opportunity to bail if you need to. Assuming all is good save and the merge will be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script leverages your installed credentials for bzr and will use
&lt;a href=&#34;https://help.launchpad.net/API/launchpadlib&#34;&gt;launchpadlib&lt;/a&gt; to authenticate
against the api on your first usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tkuhlman/scripts/blob/master/bin/mp&#34;&gt;https://github.com/tkuhlman/scripts/blob/master/bin/mp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://launchpad.net/&#34;&gt;Launchpad&lt;/a&gt; give it a try and let me know if it works or you have
any ideas to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should note it is bzr specific at this point as the reviews I do are primarily on bzr but it could be
extended with git support as needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
