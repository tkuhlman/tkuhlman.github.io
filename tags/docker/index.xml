      <description>&lt;p&gt;About 8 months ago I posted about how I run some
&lt;a href=&#34;http://backgroundprocess.com/systems/desktop_docker/&#34;&gt;applications in containers&lt;/a&gt;
so that they stay nicely contained. I have refined and changed a few things about how I do this
recently and so felt it was time for an update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Containers over VMs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently realized it has been over 6 months since I have used a VM on my workstation. Previously I
like many developers used VMs for various development tasks. The change hasn&amp;rsquo;t be in my usage of
cloud based VMs, I continue to do that as needed and appropriate. The change is that I use containers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Initial impressions of lxd</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of weeks I have been taking a bit of time here and there to explore &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/tools/lxd&#34;&gt;LXD&lt;/a&gt;.
LXD is a tool for managing system containers. As both LXD and Docker deal with containers in many ways there is quite a
bit of overlap but LXD is aiming for full isolated system containers where Docker is more focused on application containers. You can even run
Docker within an LXD image. I find it helpful to think of LXD as a replacement for virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The primary advantages of containers are realized when they are treated as the cattle of computing not pets. There are many
articles using that analogy to extol the advantages of containers as cattle or
&lt;a href=&#34;http://thenewstack.io/pets-and-cattle-symbolize-servers-so-what-does-that-make-containers-chickens/&#34;&gt;even as chickens&lt;/a&gt;.
However I have been recently rebuilding my Ubuntu Desktop and found containers can at times be great for pets also, most particularly the messy ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Docker, what use it?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone in the industry who hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet read multiple blog posts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; is living under a rock. There is a lot of hype about Docker
and its potential. I also revel in the long term vision for containers and their potential impact on the industry. However until I have an awesome
infrastructure where I can deploy images into production my practical mindset drives me to cut through the hype and ask what
use is Docker for my work today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have explored Docker here are the uses for it that I have encountered that bring practical value to my day to day work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
