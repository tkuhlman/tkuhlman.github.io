      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently realized it has been over 6 months since I have used a VM on my workstation. Previously I
like many developers used VMs for various development tasks. The change hasn&amp;rsquo;t be in my usage of
cloud based VMs, I continue to do that as needed and appropriate. The change is that I use containers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently finished building an LXD image for doing integration tests of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mojo.canonical.com&#34;&gt;Mojo&lt;/a&gt;.
I did this because I wanted to be able to reliably test the changes to Mojo that I was making. A repeatable,
standard environment that can run set of integration tests fits the bill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Initial impressions of lxd</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of weeks I have been taking a bit of time here and there to explore &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/tools/lxd&#34;&gt;LXD&lt;/a&gt;.
LXD is a tool for managing system containers. As both LXD and Docker deal with containers in many ways there is quite a
bit of overlap but LXD is aiming for full isolated system containers where Docker is more focused on application containers. You can even run
Docker within an LXD image. I find it helpful to think of LXD as a replacement for virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
