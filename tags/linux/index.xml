      <description>A few years ago I was happy to see the movement away from the complicated and fragile system V style init scripts. This is something that both Upstart and systemd accomplish well. Additionally the ability to start up services in parallel with more advanced ordering is quite useful. Though in many ways I can work with either system I am glad that the Linux community is converging on just one option, I think this standardization is a large benefit for the community as a whole.</description>
