      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-managers-goal-enable-team-productivity&#34;&gt;The Managers Goal - Enable Team Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not management expert and it is beyond my expertise to layout the value of management for an organization. On the other hand I am engineer on
a software engineering team and I do have some clear ideas on what I want from management and what I believe most of my peers also would like. It all boils
down to this, an engineering manager should enable his team to get work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most engineers a large part of their motivation is the desire to be productive. The more a manager enables this the better everything works. Not only
does more work get done, engineers are more satisfied and they have a better perception of and relationship with their manager.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
