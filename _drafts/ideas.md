# Potential Ideas
- Ansible
  - Creating Ansible modules
    - Easy!
    - A bit limited regarding including other files in with the module.
- Docker
  - How I actually use it.
  - Ansible + docker how I both build and deploy with Ansible.
- The next big challenge is the management of large amounts of containers.
  - Lots of contenders are entering this space perhaps do a review and comparison of them.
  - kubernetes, flocker, even things like apache mesos and to some extent juju fit into this.
- See ~/bin/docker-tips and make that into a blog post
