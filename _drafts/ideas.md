# Potential Ideas
- Documentation driven development
- Balancing collaboration and engineering. Steering toward synergy without going to far either direction.
- Vagrant love.
- Building packages. Various ways of doing debs, pythong packages, etc.
- git
  - workflow, lots of repos versus few, git subtree versus git submodules
- Docker
  - How I actually use it.
  - Ansible + docker how I both build and deploy with Ansible.
- The next big challenge is the management of large amounts of containers.
  - Lots of contenders are entering this space perhaps do a review and comparison of them.
  - kubernetes, flocker, even things like apache mesos and to some extent juju fit into this.
- Something golang related.
- See ~/bin/docker-tips and make that into a blog post
