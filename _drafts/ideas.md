# Potential Ideas
- Ansible
  - Ansible Galaxy
    - It prepending with username reflects that most often people will need to tweak the role for their needs.
    - I want version 1.8 so I can only push up roles which are more generalized and more likely useful for others.
  - Advanced Ansible - Creating Ansible modules and more complicated deploys
    - Address my lack of experience from my 11/2 post.
- Docker
  - How I actually use it.
  - Ansible + docker how I both build and deploy with Ansible.
- The next big challenge is the management of large amounts of containers.
  - Lots of contenders are entering this space perhaps do a review and comparison of them.
  - kubernetes, flocker, even things like apache mesos and to some extent juju fit into this.
- systemd versus upstart
- See ~/bin/docker-tips and make that into a blog post
