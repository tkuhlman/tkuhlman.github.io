# Potential Ideas
- Documentation driven development
- Balancing collaboration and engineering. Steering toward synergy without going to far either direction.
- Vagrant love.
- Building packages. Various ways of doing debs, pythong packages, etc.
- git
  - workflow, lots of repos versus few, git subtree versus git submodules
- Docker
  - How I actually use it.
  - Ansible + docker how I both build and deploy with Ansible.
- The next big challenge is the management of large amounts of containers.
  - Lots of contenders are entering this space perhaps do a review and comparison of them.
  - kubernetes, flocker, even things like apache mesos and to some extent juju fit into this.
- Something golang related.
- See ~/bin/docker-tips and make that into a blog post

## Non-technical ideas - these I suspect will live as drafts for a long time.
- An engineers perspective on the value of good management.
  - Enabling the engineers to work.
    - Engaging engineers on appropriate planning but not stifling them with it.
    - Removing organizational road blocks to progress.
    - Fostering a collaborative environment.
    - Being an a voice and ear to the rest of the organization and appropriately sharing with the team.
- Architects who don't know details are impediments to progress rather than enablers.
- The importance of running the service you work on.
  - It proves the product.
  - It bring fast feedback loops that help you to improve the product, as you get immediate clarity on bugs, needed features and annoyances.
  - Reveals scale and operational issues that are difficult to discover any other way.
  - It helps developers truly understand the use cases.
  - Coupled with ci/cd you improve development speed and quality through smaller more automated deploys
  - Increases developer satisfaction through allowing a developer to work hard on something, deploy it and immediately see it used in
    a real installation.
  - Leverages the motivation that naturally comes from being on call and responsible.
