I am not management expert and it is beyond my expertise to layout the value of management for an organization. On the other hand I am engineer on
a software engineering and I do have some clear ideas on what I want from management and what I believe most of my peers also would like. It all boils
down to this, an engineering manager should enable his team to get work done. For most engineers a large part of their motivation is the desire to
be productive. The more a manager enables this the better they perceive their manager.

The nature of management, or any other discipline primarily concerning people, is such that you can't define exactly what that means for most situations.
I believe this is a large part of the reason that a few managers are horribly bad, a small proportion great, but most find themselves somewhere in
the middle. What can be clearly laid out are some general principles that enable engineers to get work done. 

Within the team
    - Engaging engineers on appropriate planning but not stifling them with it.
    - Fostering a collaborative environment.
    - rewarding achievement.

Within the organization
    - Removing organizational road blocks to progress.
    - Being an a voice and ear to the rest of the organization and appropriately sharing with the team.
    - Being a catalyst and enabler for cross-team collaboration.
