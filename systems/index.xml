      <description>&lt;p&gt;About 8 months ago I posted about how I run some
&lt;a href=&#34;http://backgroundprocess.com/systems/desktop_docker/&#34;&gt;applications in containers&lt;/a&gt;
so that they stay nicely contained. I have refined and changed a few things about how I do this
recently and so felt it was time for an update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The primary advantages of containers are realized when they are treated as the cattle of computing not pets. There are many
articles using that analogy to extol the advantages of containers as cattle or
&lt;a href=&#34;http://thenewstack.io/pets-and-cattle-symbolize-servers-so-what-does-that-make-containers-chickens/&#34;&gt;even as chickens&lt;/a&gt;.
However I have been recently rebuilding my Ubuntu Desktop and found containers can at times be great for pets also, most particularly the messy ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Initial impressions of systemd</title>

      <description>A few years ago I was happy to see the movement away from the complicated and fragile system V style init scripts. This is something that both Upstart and systemd accomplish well. Additionally the ability to start up services in parallel with more advanced ordering is quite useful. Though in many ways I can work with either system I am glad that the Linux community is converging on just one option, I think this standardization is a large benefit for the community as a whole.</description>
