My blog posts themselves speak to why to blog here are some notes on how things are setup.
- As should be obvious I am using Jekyll and github pages to host the site. Some details:
  - I built a very simple custom theme.
  - I am using the directory is the category style of organization for my posts and then making heavy use of tags.
- I use google analytics to watch traffic.
- I am using disqus for comments. Though comments could get out of hand and suck away my time they could also enable
  intelligent discussion that will help me clarify my thoughts and learn better. The potential gain is worth the risk.
  - This page has a simple way to disable comments on a page by page basis. For now I just have it on for all posts,

- I am doing no ads the annoyance/gain trade off is solidly on the no ads side.
