I'm Tim Kuhlman a systems engineer and software developer primarily working with infrastructure automation.

This blog is the output of all the background processes running in my head. By no means is that meant to
indicate that this is the left over thoughts that emerge after I have focused on the important things.
Though I may occasionally use the blog as a place to record simple tips, for most posts one of my goals
is to take ideas from my diffuse thinking periods and develop them into fully formed ideas worth sharing.
For more detail on these goals see my post on [why I started a blog.](/learning/2014/10/27/time-to-blog.html)
